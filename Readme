# My Node App

This project uses Docker to build and run the application. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ai-ambassador-hub/basic-auth-with-expressjs.git
    cd basic-auth-with-expressjs
    ```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment variables. For example:

    ```env
    PORT=3000
    BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=admin
    BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password
    ```

3. **Make the `run_docker.sh` script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x run_docker.sh
    ```

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    ./run_docker.sh
    ```

This will build the Docker image and run the container using Docker Compose, with environment variables loaded from the `.env` file.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
    
This command will stop and remove the Docker containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
